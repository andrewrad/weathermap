# WeatherMap
A sweet little app that allows the user to get weather details for any location on earth by simply long-pressing a location. Weather is retreived in real-time from an open weather api server. Details about the weather are overlaid on the map. 

If location services are turned on, weathermap will find weather at your location automatically.

You will need to provide your own api key. This is easily acquired from the openweathermap.com api. Insert your key into the string constant WEATHER_API_KEY at src\main\java\com\radicaldroids\weathermap\Constants.java
